# Welcome to the MealMate API Service

**Cook smarter, not harder.**

The MealMate RESTful API is a powerful yet simple tool designed to help users and developers alike tackle the everyday challenge of meal planning. It provides programmatic access to a database of recipes, ingredients, and pre-designed meal plans. [Learn more](./mmoverview.md) about how the service can help you build an app for your busy meal planners.

The MealMate API contains three resources:

* [Ingredients](./reference/mmGET-ingredients-id.md): Enables meal planners to browse commonly stocked pantry items available in the MealMate API database.
* [Recipes](./reference/recipes.md): Provides meal suggestions based on their preferred ingredients, time constraints, and dietary needs.
* [Plans](./reference/plans.md): Provides pre-designed meal plans for a set number of days and filtered by dietary needs.
